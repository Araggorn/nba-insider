My own project - web application - where user can register an account, 
log into the system and provide data of his favourite team and player in NBA.
After that, he get access to main page, where he can observe how many users have similar interests. 
App will provide as well Twitter account of his favourite team. 
Visitor, even if he is not logged user, can check most liked teams and players.
Admin can manage users, teams, players and contact form (CRUD). 
The application can be found online - https://nba-insider.herokuapp.com

Used technologies: Java 14, JDBC, SQL, Thymeleaf, Spring Boot,
